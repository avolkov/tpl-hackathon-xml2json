tpl_hackathon
===========

The goal of this project is to conver all presented XML data into JSON making it more available to the developers.

`tpl_xml2json.py` -- reads input `tpl.xml` and outputs `tpl.json`
`tpl_read_json.py` -- reads in `tpl.json` produced with `tpl_xml2json.py`  and stops at debug point waiting for the user input.
